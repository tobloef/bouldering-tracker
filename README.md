# Bouldering Tracker
I needed a simple bouldering attempt tracker that supported custom grades for my local gyms, so I made this in a couple of hours. It uses React for the frontend and Supabase for the backend (Row-level Security is cool!).

You likely won't get much use from this, unless you're one of my local climbing buddies :)
